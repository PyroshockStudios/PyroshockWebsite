      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in The Netherlands, Pyroshock Studios started as a small team of passionate developers
        with a shared dream: to create efficient software and fun games.
      </p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We want to make efficiency and <em>fun</em> the standard, and not a luxury,<br/>
		    We want to bring the market back to the consumer,<br/>
        We want to fight against planned obselecense,<br/>
		    And right now, we are starting by providing private software contracts, delivering custom solutions for clients, and
        developing our own in-house game titles like <a href="http://www.derbyheat.com" target="_blank">Derby Heat</a>. 
        Efficiency, research, and a passion for quality is what we are, which is why we build 
        our own tools like the <a href="https://github.com/ZilverBlade/Shard3DDocs" target="_blank">Shard3D Engine</a>.<br/>
		    But we also want to share our efforts, and give access to efficient libraries to the developer, and inspire them to follow our footsteps in making a change, 
		    which is why we provide open source libraries like <a href="https://github.com/PyroshockStudios/Shockgraph" target="_blank">ShockGraph</a> which has been
		    extensively tested and designed to provide a wide range of compatibility, ease of access, and performance.
